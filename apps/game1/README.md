# TDD Game

Tried Tape https://github.com/substack/tape. Could require('tape') in code that run on server and browser. 

Tried mocha integration with browser-run. Was not successful. `require('mocha')` was not running. https://github.com/aruns07/Playground/tree/c62682c594b9e23cff9d346d72930c0eacb02a29/apps/game1
